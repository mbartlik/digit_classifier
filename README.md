# Handwritten Digit Classifier

## Description
This project designs a model based off the MNIST dataset, a large collection of handwritten digits. Once the model is generated, it can run the model on a test set of unseen data and then see what its accuracy is. My greatest model was able to predict the value of handwritten digits correctly 98.48% of the time.
